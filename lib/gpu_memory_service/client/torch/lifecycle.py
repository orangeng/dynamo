"""GPU Memory Service lifecycle management.

This module manages the singleton GPU Memory Service memory manager and its integrated
PyTorch MemPool for routing weight allocations through the GPU Memory Service.

Key principles:
- Only one memory manager per process
- Write mode creates MemPool for PyTorch integration
- Read mode (import-only) doesn't need MemPool
- Mode transitions: write → read via switch_to_read() only

Usage:
    # Write mode (cold start):
    manager, pool = get_or_create_allocator(socket_path, device, mode="write")
    with use_mem_pool(pool, device=device):
        # ... load model weights ...
    manager.switch_to_read()

    # Read mode (import-only):
    manager, _ = get_or_create_allocator(socket_path, device, mode="read")
    # ... materialize weights from metadata store ...

    # Consumers (e.g., sleep/wake):
    manager = get_allocator()
    if manager:
        manager.sleep()

    """Get the existing memory manager or create a new one.

    This is the primary way to obtain a memory manager. The module enforces
    that only one memory manager exists per process.

    For write mode:
    - Creates memory manager in write mode
    - Sets up CUDAPluggableAllocator and MemPool for PyTorch integration
    - Initializes malloc/free callbacks

    For read mode:
    - Creates memory manager in read mode (for import-only)
    - No MemPool needed (weights already on GPU)

    For auto mode:
    - Tries to acquire RW lock; if another writer is active, falls back to RO
    - Useful for multiprocess architectures where only one process should write
    - After connection, check manager.mode to see if "write" or "read" was granted

    Args:
        socket_path: Unix socket path for the allocation server.
        device: CUDA device index.
        mode: Desired mode - "write" for cold start, "read" for import-only,
              "auto" for RW if available else RO.
        tag: Allocation tag for write mode (default: "weights").
        timeout_ms: Timeout in milliseconds for lock acquisition.
                    None means wait indefinitely.

    Returns:
        Tuple of (memory_manager, pool). Pool is None for read mode.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If a memory manager exists but is in incompatible mode:
            - Requesting "write" when manager is in read mode (can't go back)
            - Requesting "read" when manager is in write mode (call switch_to_read first)
